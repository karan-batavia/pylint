`invalid-name` now distinguishes module-level names that are assigned only once
from those that are reassigned and now applies `--variable-rgx` to the latter.

Remember that `--good-names` or `--good-names-rgxs` can be provided to explicitly
allow good names.

Also, `invalid-name` is triggered for module-level names for additional types
(e.g. lists and sets).

Closes #3585
